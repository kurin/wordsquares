# wordsquares

This code finds word squares, which are squares of words:

    viscera
    intones
    stances
    condole
    encoder
    reelect
    asserts

Note that the first row is also the first column, etc.

It's pretty quick.  There aren't any squares with words longer than 7
characters, in my dictionary at least.
